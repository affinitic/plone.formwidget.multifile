* Updated URL on setup.py

1.0a3 (2012-12-20)
------------------

* Changed the UI so now there's a link to "add files" instead of an standard
  input[type=file] HTML element (which still exists, but is hidden). Users were
  complaining that the old UI was confusing since the textbox of the
  input[type=file] element was always empty.

1.0a2 (2012-12-20)
------------------

* Removed integration with jQuery plugin. Instead we use HTML and javascript,
  and when applicable, the "multiple" extension from HTML5 which lets a
  user upload multiple files at once.
  [tmog]

* Fix minor bugs on the new non-flash implementation.
  [rafaelbco]
